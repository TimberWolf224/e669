# e669

This is an experimental alternate client/browser for e621 intended to improve upon the limitations and design flaws of [e621.net](https://e621.net)'s standard browsing experience.

The primary purpose is to create a smoother and more flexible interface for browsing e621 and its content, minimizing the amount of extra clicks and actions needed to effectively navigate the website.

It is currently a work in progress and many planned features are not yet implemented.
